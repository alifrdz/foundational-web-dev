# Project 10: API Mini-Dashboard (Combined Skills)

This project is my first JavaScript application that combines two core skills: fetching real-time data from an API and manipulating that data on the frontend.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

To combine the skills from Project 08 (`fetch`) with the skills from Project 09 (`.map`, `.filter`, `.reduce`) to build a simple, interactive dashboard.

## ðŸš€ Features & Concepts Practiced

- **Async JavaScript (`fetch`)**: Fetching product data from a public API (e.g., FakeStoreAPI).
- **DOM Manipulation**: Rendering the processed data into the HTML (`.innerHTML` and `.join('')`).
- **`.map()` + `fetch`**: Transforming the API data (array of objects) into HTML elements (array of strings) for a full product display.
- **`.filter()` + `fetch`**: Adding button functionality to filter the API data based on criteria (e.g., low price) and render only the results.
- **`.reduce()` + `fetch`**: Using the API data to calculate a single aggregate value (e.g., total inventory value) and display it.
